We are looking for developers, testers, software architects with an opinion on how tobuild software ‘right’.  Calling all agile/lean coaches, scrum masters and product owners, if you have something to say it’s time to speak up! If you work for an organisation developing software, work at computer science or software engineeringresearch institutions, or promote software related activities please submit your paper!

On 26th March 2020, Build IT Right will offer a full programme of keynotes, lightning talks and panel sessions. In 2019 we hosted keynote speeches from Dave Farley, Timandra Harkness and Simon Brown, alongside 27 global speakers selected from our 2019 call for papers. All selected speakers will gain a delegate pass for the event, plus a discount for colleagues.

Our breakout sessions are 40 minutes in length, with the option to also submit for a lightning talk. Our streams include Architecture, Development Process, Development Technologies, and UX & UR, and we are looking forward to your cool ideas for 2020!

We encourage you to submit a topic you are passionate about, but we can accept multiple submissions from an orgainsation or individual.

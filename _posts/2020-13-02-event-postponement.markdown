EVENT POSTPONEMENT:<br/>
Build IT Right 26 March

We have taken the difficult decision to postpone the upcoming Build IT Right conference in light of the global impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. We are pleased to announce the conference will now be held on 12th November 2020.

The health and well-being of the Build IT Right community is our main priority and given the increasing number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the UK, we considered it inappropriate and unwise to hold such a gathering in a confined setting. The opportunity to meet and interact with the software community is at the heart of Build IT Right and whilst disappointing, we feel it is the right decision to postpone in order maintain the quality of the conference, whilst giving you enough notice to plan.

We're aiming to put on the same great speakers, but you might notice a slight change in line-up but you'll be the first to know.

All conference passes will be automatically transferred to the new date. If you are unable to make the new date please contact [bitrconference@gmail.com](mailto:bitrconference@gmail.com)

Please accept our apologies for any inconvenience caused. We're looking forward to welcoming our speakers, supporters and community to the event in the autumn.

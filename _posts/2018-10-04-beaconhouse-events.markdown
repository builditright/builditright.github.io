The North East is a hotbed of digital talent and creativity. It's filled with highly skilled people building inspiring things and constantly seeking solutions. We've had blogs, and podcasts so what is the next thing?
  Well let us tell you…it's time to organise a conference. When arranging meetings you create memorable experiences, there is nothing comparable to a conference. There is a unique atmosphere, a crowd passionate about the same subject, you learn, meet old friends and make new pals. Delegates leave conferences feeling energised and full of new ideas, with a new tote, t-shirt and stickers for the laptop in tow.   
  So we were thrilled to be asked by experts in the field, Opencast Software, to bring together like-minded talented specialists in the software industry to deliver the first 'Build IT Right'. 
  Build IT Right Conference aims to showcase the very best that the industry has to offer, highlight trends, expand knowledge and inspire delegates. 

Here at BeaconHouse Events we have a proven track record delivering a wide range of events regionally and across the UK, including the Northern Powerhouse Business Summit, BIM Show Live and Dynamo North East events, so we are well placed to create an interesting and informative event for professionals in specialist fields. 
What can delegates expect?

* To be inspired by high-profile speakers.
* You'll be able to 'sharpen the saw'. Everyone needs a break from work to hone their skills and advance learning with new tips and tactics.
* Meet people FACE to FACE, the room will be full of experts looking to network, maybe you'll get a selfie with your business idol, you certainly can't do that online. 
* It's fun (well-organised fun we promise!)…with a well deserved drinks reception at the end of the day.

When attending conferences, you sacrifice money and time, so you need to know it’s right for you. If you have an opinion on How to ‘Build IT Right’, this cool-sounding event has cool people going, that you’ll definitely want to meet. Built IT Right welcomes delegates who speak HTML, CSS, SQL, Java, Bash/Shell, Python, C#, PHP and Klingon.

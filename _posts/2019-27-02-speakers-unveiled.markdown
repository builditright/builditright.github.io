A HOST of top speakers has been unveiled for the inaugural 2019 conference.

The conference is aimed at anyone in the north east building software, and two speakers had already been announced: Dave Farley, author and founder of Continuous Delivery Ltd, and Simon Brown, author of Software Architecture for Developers.

Now a range of other conference speakers have been confirmed:

* Jesse Carey, Head of Application Architecture at Bede Gaming;
* Juan Antonio Rodriguez Pozo, Senior Consultant at Opencast Software;
* Chris Price, Software Engineer at Scott Logic;
* Jon McNestrie, Coach and Trainer at Northern Shore Consulting;
* Jason Bell, User Researcher;
* Nate Sterling, Design Strategist, Grid Smarter Cities;
* Robert Rees, Head of Engineering, We Got POP;
* Bartosz Jadrzejewski, Technical Principal, Scott Logic;
* Chris Howe-Jones CEO and founder, DevCycle Ltd;
* Peter Grainger, Senior Engineer at Sage;
* Alex Lynham, Senior Software Engineer, Yapster;
* Helena Hill, Digital Mentor, Helena Hill Consulting;
* Gary Fleming, Agile Consultant at Emphasis Parenthesis Ltd and
* David Boyne, Application Architect at CompareTheMarket.

There will also be lightning talks from James Murphy and Mark Jose while Stephen Mounsey will deliver a session on working with conflict in teams.

The event will be hosted by presenter, writer and comedian Timandra Harkness, who is currently presenting the BBC Radio 4 series How to Disagree. Timandra will also be one of the conference speakers.

Fiona Hobbs from Opencast Software, who is leading the organising committee, said: “We’ve worked hard to ensure the best possible speakers and I’m delighted with the quality and range who have agreed to speak to delegates.

“Talented people from some of the region’s most successful companies will be sharing their experience and tips. Build IT Right is for ‘do-ers’ in the North East who are passionate about software development. It’s aimed at those at the coal-face of technology – the programmers and coders, the developers, testers and solution architects – and our list of speakers reflects that.

“We want the conference to expand delegates’ knowledge and be inspired by emerging trends. There will also be great opportunities to network, but it won’t be a talking shop - the aim is to give hands-on, practical advice on shared issues and problems.”

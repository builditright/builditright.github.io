  title: "An ongoing journey with micro-services and DDD"
  description: "In only 6 years, Bede Gaming has built a globally competitive gaming platform in Microsoft’s Azure cloud using micro-service architecture. This talk briefly retraces our architectural journey from startup to industry leader, how our optimal team structure was affected by the architecture as we grew and how the influence of Domain Driven Design has more recently impacted our views on the trade-offs of the architecture we chose and how we could optimise it moving forward."

  description: |
    Machine Learning has had a transformative effect on many industries, but rarely has it been so rapidly adopted as in finance. It can be found identifying fraud, optimising sales targeting, high-frequency trading and far more besides.<br/>
    This talk focuses on its recent intersection with the web and demonstrates what’s possible right now (with some audience participation!). We'll prove that once again proves you can teach an old dog new tricks and ponder on the future directions this technology might take us.

  title: "U-Kan-Scrum-gile - Enterprise Edition"
  description: |
    There has been a rise recently in organisations saying that they 'Do Agile' without fully understanding what they mean. There also seems to be a loss of faith in Scrum and other agile frameworks from people who see them as a way to sell something to large companies; set of rules to follow and then somehow attain success.<br/>
    This is a very quick tongue in cheek introduction of a fictitious Agile Framework especially designed to appeal to stereotypical senior management with lofty promises.<br/>
    The idea of snake oil salesmen and turnkey frameworks has continued to poison the 'agile industry' and is making it harder to focus people on good problem solving and iterative delivery.

  title: "Automate all the security"
  description: "We are a small company but we work with big corporate clients who have heavy Information and Cyber Security procurement processes in place. To avoid crushing development under the weight of 'secure programming practices' and 'security review' we have had to turn to automation and the use of cloud services to provide a regular automated security screening and review service. Using these has helped not just get through enterprise security reviews but also helped us discover issues in our application and build a more secure platform as a result."

  title: "Designing the Invisible: How to Create Exceptional User Experiences"
  description: "Creating first impressions that lead to early on-boarding and lasting user engagement should be at the forefront of any plans to create meaningful and profitable software.<br/>
During this 40 minute presentation delegates will learn about essential discovery tools, good design practice and how defining their proposition in a clear, minimal yet inviting style leads to business success and increased customer acquisition and retention.<br/>
It is now widely accepted that exceptional user experiences are crucial to organisational success and longevity. One of the main reasons for failure as a software business is neglecting to get this right from the start. The presentation will focus on the foundations of good UX; the importance of user research and testing as well as featuring some key design takeaways and lessons that can be built into user interfaces to increase initial on-boarding and customer retention."

We often adopt approaches to continuously deploy our systems, but what if we had tools that let us continuously upgrade them too; pushing the entropy back a little bit each day."

  title: "Using Inner Source to drive innovation, culture and collaboration"
  description: "Open Source software is transforming the world. In 2018 GitHub had over 30 million developers using the platform, sharing ideas, and creating cultures. Over 96 million repositories were created with over 200 million pull requests. The Open Source community have developed principles, techniques and ways of working which I believe can be applied to any organisation.<br/>
What if we could take the learnings from the Open Source community and apply them to our internal teams and our organisation? What can we learn from these learnings to help us drive innovation, culture and collaboration?<br/>
People around the world are also observing the lessons that the Open Source community can teach us and have created a new community and set of practices called the InnerSource commons.<br/>
In this talk, I will share with you how CompareTheMarket is using InnerSource practices to drive our culture, innovation, and collaboration across Peterborough, London & Belarus. I share with you the cultural challenges I’ve faced over the past few years implementing these InnerSource principles and technology we have used to help.<br/>
Walking away from this talk I’m confident that you can take away some of these ideas and lessons I have learned and hopefully apply these techniques to help you scale and remain flexible for the future."
